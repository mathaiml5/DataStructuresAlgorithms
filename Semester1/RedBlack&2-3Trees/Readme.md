## Assignment 10
### 2-3 Trees
#### Problem 1:  2-3 trees that result when the keys YLPMXHCRAESTBCA in that order into an initially empty 2-3 tree.

### Red-Black Trees
(Left leaning red-black (LLRB) trees)
#### Problem 3: Red-black trees that result when you insert the keys Y L P M X H C R A E S T B C A in that order into an initially empty tree.

#### Problem 5: Implement a Red-Black tree using the code provided in textbook (Sedgewick, Algorithms -4th ed) section 3.3 and problems 3.39 â€“ 3.41. 
* Insert the keys 1 to 60 in increasing order into an empty tree. Draw the resulting tree by hand.

* Then delete keys 1 to 20 in increasing order. Draw the resulting tree after deleting the first 20 numbers (i.e., after deleting 1-20). You can draw the tree by hand.
