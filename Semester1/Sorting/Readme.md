## Assignment 6

### Problem 1.1: Trace of Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, & Bubblesort
Trace after each outer loop for sorting the sequence I, L, O, V, E, A, L, G, O, R, I, T, H, M, S using elementary sorts Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, & Bubblesort

#### Comparison of time complexity of Bubblesort, Selection sort and Insertion sort algorithms
| Sorting Algorithm | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case | Remark |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ |
| Bubble Sort | Ω(N) | Θ( $N^2$ ) | O( $N^2$ ) | Stop after reaching sorted array |
| Selection Sort | Ω( $N^2$ ) | Θ( $N^2$) | O( $N^2$) | Even a perfectly sorted input requires scanning the entire array |
| Insertion Sort | Ω(N) | Θ( $N^2$) | O( $N^2$) | In the best case (already sorted), every insert requires constant time |

Note: All 3 have a worst case space complexity of O(N)

### Problem 1.2: Trace of ShellSort Algorithm
Trace in the style of the example discussed in class, how shell sort works for the array E,A,S,Y,S,H,E,L,L,S,O,R,T,Q,U,E,S,T,I,O,N

### Problem 2: Trace of Bottoms Up and Top Down MergeSort Algorithms
Trace in the style discussed in class, showing how the keys I, L, O, V, E, A, L, G, O, R, I, T, H, M, S are sorted using 2 different mergesort algorithms.
