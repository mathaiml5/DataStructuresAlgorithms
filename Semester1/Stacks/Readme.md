## Assignment 2

### Stacks
The MyStack class implements a stack using an arraylist, which has elements that are of a generic type, in order to help with converting infix notation
to postfix notation and uses the stack in computing the result from a stack in postfix notation.    

### Arithmetic Expression Evaluator
The ArithmeticExpressionEvaluator class first uses the MyStack class to convert an expression in Infix notation to 
Postfix notation, and then evaluates the postfix expression.
