## Assignment 9

### Problem 1: Symbol Tables
Trace of inserting the letters of the word EASYQUESTION into an initially empty table using SequentialSearchST 
Trace of inserting the letters of the word EASYQUESTION into an initially empty table using BinarySearchST




### Problem 2: Binary Search Tree (BST)
* a Trace when we insert the keys M I D T E R M Q U E S T I O N, in that order (associating the value i with the ith key, as per the convention discussed in class) into an initially empty binary tree.
* b Sequence of BSTs that result when we delete the keys from the tree in question 2a, one by one, in the order they were inserted 
* c Sequence of BSTs that result when we delete the keys from the tree in question 2.a, one by one, in alphabetical order. 
* d Sequence of BSTs when deleting the keys from the tree in question 2a, one by one, successively deleting the root key. 
* e Give the sequences of nodes examined when the methods in BST are used to compute each of the following quantities for the tree in question 2a 
  1. floor("P") 
  2. select(5) 
  3. ceiling("V") 
  4. rank("S")
